## Abstract

This project was created to resolve the systemic issues of high fees, payment insecurity, and biased reputation systems that plague the current freelance marketplace ecosystem. Current centralized platforms like Upwork and Fiverr charge exorbitant commissions, with 58% of freelancers reporting payment delays or non-payment. Their proprietary scoring algorithms and opaque dispute resolution processes create significant barriers for new talent and can lead to unfair outcomes. 

The proposed project aims to solve the "cold-start problem" that prevents new freelancers from securing work and addresses the financial risk both parties face due to insecure payment handling and prolonged disputes. It also targets the lack of transparency and portability in current reputation systems, which locks users into a single platform. The project fills the gap for a unified freelance platform that combines automated smart-contract escrow, transparent on-chain reputation, and an AI-driven solution to instantly assess newcomer capability. 

The system aims to eliminate cold-start barriers for new users through AI-powered capability assessment and guarantee universal payment security with automated escrow smart contracts. Furthermore, it will deliver auditable, transparent trust scores for both clients and freelancers and ensure fair dispute outcomes via decentralized community arbitration. As a final product, DeTrust creates a sustainable, transparent, and meritocratic marketplace where talent, not platform algorithms, drives success for all participants.

# Chapter 1: Introduction and Problem Definition

This chapter provides an overview of the DeTrust project. It outlines the project's vision, defines the problems within the current freelance ecosystem, presents the proposed solution and objectives, and details the project's scope, limitations, and core modules.

### 1.1 Overview of the Project
DeTrust is a decentralized web application designed to overcome systemic inefficiencies and trust deficits prevalent in current freelance platforms. The project is a web-based information system that incorporates problem-solving through artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Users, including freelancers and clients, authenticate via crypto wallets to create profiles and interact within the marketplace. The system leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to secure payments in escrow, ensuring funds are released only upon job completion or a binding arbitration decision. All transactions, reviews, and dispute records are stored immutably on the blockchain, fostering transparency and reducing fraud. To address the challenges faced by newcomers, DeTrust provides an instant capability assessment using AI-powered profile analysis, creating a fair and meritocratic ecosystem.

### 1.2 Vision Statement
For freelancers and clients who require a transparent, reliable, and equitable digital marketplace to collaborate effectively, Who currently struggle with the systemic inefficiencies of centralized platforms, including opaque commission fees, persistent payment delays, biased reputation systems that create entry barriers (the "cold-start problem"), and slow, often unfair, dispute resolution processes, The DeTrust Is a fully decentralized, blockchain-powered freelance marketplace That fundamentally redefines trust and capability by securing all payments through automated smart contract escrows, recording feedback as immutable on-chain records, and providing an instant, objective capability assessment for newcomers via an AI-powered analysis of their skills and portfolio. It delivers a progressive and fully transparent trust score for all participants, ensuring that reputation is earned through verifiable performance. Unlike existing centralized platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr, which operate as opaque intermediaries that control user data, dictate high fees, and foster an environment of uncertainty, our product empowers its users by combining automated financial security, auditable reputation scoring, and community-driven arbitration. This creates a truly meritocratic ecosystem where verified talent and fair, transparent processes drive sustainable success and foster long-term professional relationships.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Current freelance marketplaces are hindered by persistent issues that limit fairness, trust, and efficiency. New freelancers face the "cold-start problem," where a lack of reviews prevents them from securing jobs, as platform algorithms favor established workers. Centralized platforms impose high fees; for instance, Upwork charges a sliding commission of up to 15% [3], while Fiverr deducts a flat 20% from freelancer earnings [4]. Payment insecurity is a major risk, with 58% of freelancers reporting delayed or missing payments, and 40% waiting over 30 days for their compensation [5]. Dispute resolution processes are often slow and opaque; on platforms like Upwork, resolving a dispute can involve multiple stages and paid arbitration, extending timelines significantly [6, 7]. Finally, platform-specific reputation systems are proprietary, preventing freelancers from transferring their hard-earned credibility to other platforms, which creates vendor lock-in [1]. These combined problems of newcomer exclusion, high fees, payment delays, opaque scoring, and lengthy disputes erode trust for all participants.

### 1.4 Problem Solution
DeTrust addresses the core problems of the freelance industry by leveraging blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. To counter high fees and payment delays, the system uses blockchain-based smart contracts that automatically hold client funds in escrow and release them upon completion, reducing transaction fees to just 1–3%. All feedback is stored on-chain via cryptographic hashing, creating portable and tamper-proof reputation records that cannot be altered. To solve the "cold-start problem," a machine learning model analyzes new freelancers' profiles based on skills, certifications, and projects to generate an objective credibility score, allowing them to compete fairly from day one. Finally, dispute resolution is decentralized and unbiased, with juror selection and voting weighted by reputation, ensuring fair outcomes are reached within days instead of weeks.

### 1.5 Objectives of the Proposed System
* **BO-1:** Secure client payments in escrow, releasing funds only upon client approval or verified arbitration.
* **BO-2:** Store feedback immutably on-chain to prevent review alteration.
* **BO-3:** Automate fair dispute resolution through decentralized, reputation-weighted voting.
* **BO-4:** Implement an initial rule-based trust score (weighted-average of ratings, completion rate, dispute rate) for transparency.
* **BO-5:** Use a transparent, rule-based trust scoring system for both freelancers and clients.
* **BO-6:** Provide instant capability assessment for new users via AI-powered profile analysis and lightweight microtask verification to reduce cold-start risk.
* **BO-7:** Deliver real-time dashboards showing trust scores, AI capability predictions, and historical trends.
* **BO-8:** Deliver real-time, event-driven notifications and wallet-linked messaging to keep participants informed and responsive.

### 1.6 Scope
DeTrust is a decentralized web application (DApp) designed to be accessed via Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask on Layer-2 networks to ensure low fees and fast transactions. The platform's scope includes functionalities for clients to post detailed job listings and for freelancers to browse, filter, and submit proposals for those jobs. A core feature is the smart contract-based payment system, which locks funds in escrow and automates their release upon mutual agreement or the conclusion of an arbitration process. The system will establish trust through transparent, rule-based scoring models for both freelancers and clients. For new users, an AI capability module will analyze profile signals and use microtasks to generate an initial credibility score, effectively solving the cold-start problem. The scope also includes a complete dispute resolution system where evidence is stored on IPFS and juror voting is enforced by smart contracts.

### 1.8 Related System Analysis/Literature Review

#### 1.8.1 Literature Review
Existing literature on online labor platforms highlights significant challenges related to algorithmic fairness and entry barriers for new participants. Research has identified the "cold-start problem," where new freelancers without a reputation struggle to attract clients, as recommendation algorithms inherently favor those with an established history [1]. Furthermore, studies from institutions like the Kellogg School of Management have pointed to algorithmic bias in gig economy platforms, where opaque, proprietary systems can perpetuate inequalities in job distribution [2]. Many existing systems are centralized, leading to a lack of transparency in how reputations are calculated, and disputes are handled. Our project addresses these gaps by introducing a decentralized architecture where reputation is recorded immutably on a blockchain, ensuring it is both transparent and tamper-proof. Additionally, we directly tackle the cold-start problem by integrating an AI-driven capability assessment model to provide new users with an objective, verifiable measure of their skills from the outset.

### 1.10 Project Contribution
The DeTrust system introduces several key technical and conceptual contributions to the freelance marketplace ecosystem:

* **AI-Powered Newcomer Assessment:** The system directly addresses the "cold-start problem" by using an AI model to analyze a new user's profile and skills, providing an instant and objective capability score. This allows new talent to compete on merit rather than being excluded due to a lack of platform-specific history.
* **Decentralized and Transparent Trust Scoring:** Unlike the opaque, proprietary algorithms of existing platforms, DeTrust implements a transparent, rule-based mathematical formula for calculating trust scores for both freelancers and clients. All data feeding into this score is derived from on-chain actions, ensuring it is auditable and fair.
* **Automated Financial Security via Smart Contracts:** By using smart contract-based escrow, the system automates payment security, eliminating the risks of delayed or non-payment that plague the industry. This "trustless" mechanism significantly reduces the need for intermediaries and lowers transaction fees.
* **Immutable and Portable Reputation:** All feedback, project completions, and dispute outcomes are recorded on the blockchain. This creates a tamper-proof, permanent record of a user's reputation that is owned by the user and is inherently portable.
* **Fair and Efficient Community-Driven Arbitration:** The project introduces a decentralized dispute resolution system where reputation-weighted community jurors vote on outcomes. This removes the potential for platform bias and dramatically speeds up the resolution process compared to traditional, centralized mediation.

**Contribution Impact:** By integrating AI and blockchain technology, the DeTrust system transforms the conventional freelance platform from a centralized, opaque intermediary into a decentralized, transparent, and meritocratic ecosystem. These contributions significantly improve efficiency through automated escrow, enhance fairness via auditable trust scoring and community arbitration, and boost user confidence by providing immutable reputation records. This holistic approach creates a more sustainable and equitable environment for both freelancers and clients compared to traditional freelance solutions.

### 1.11 Relevance to Course Modules

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.3.1 Reliability
* **REL-1:** The system's off-chain components (web server, APIs) shall be highly available. The application should handle temporary connection losses to the blockchain network gracefully, informing the user of the status without crashing.
* **REL-2:** The smart contracts shall be developed following industry security best practices (e.g., OpenZeppelin standards) and tested against common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy). The contracts shall include an emergency-stop (pausable) mechanism controllable by the system administrator.
* **REL-3:** The system shall ensure all on-chain actions are atomic. All feedback and transaction records stored on-chain shall be considered final and irreversible once confirmed by the network.

#### 2.3.2 Usability
* **USE-1:** A new user familiar with crypto wallets should be able to connect their wallet, create a profile, and perform a core action (post a job or submit a proposal) in under 10 minutes.
* **USE-2:** The user interface shall abstract away blockchain complexities. Users will interact with clear buttons (e.g., "Fund Project," "Approve Milestone") and will not need to manually handle smart contract addresses or technical transaction details.
* **USE-3:** The system shall provide immediate and clear visual feedback for the status of all significant actions, especially asynchronous ones like blockchain transactions (e.g., "Funding Escrow...", "Transaction Confirmed").

#### 2.3.3 Performance
* **PERF-1:** The user interface shall update to reflect the confirmed status of on-chain transactions (e.g., escrow funded) within 60 seconds of the user signing the transaction, contingent on the Layer-2 network's confirmation time.
* **PERF-2:** The AI capability score for a freelancer profile shall be generated and displayed within 60 seconds of the user initiating the scan.
* **PERF-3:** The web application's main pages (Dashboard, Job Board) shall achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 4 seconds on a standard broadband connection.

#### 2.3.4 Security
* **SEC-1:** All communication between the client-side DApp and any off-chain backend services shall be encrypted using TLS 1.3 (HTTPS) when deployed.
* **SEC-2:** The system shall operate non-custodially. User private keys will never be stored or handled by the system; all transactions must be signed by the user through their external wallet application.
* **SEC-3:** The system will implement role-based access control for administrative functions to prevent unauthorized changes to platform-level smart contract parameters.
* **SEC-4:** To ensure data integrity and reduce on-chain costs, large files (e.g., portfolio items, dispute evidence) will be stored on IPFS, with only the resulting hash being logged on the blockchain.

#### 2.3.5 Maintainability
* **MAIN-1:** The source code for both the smart contracts and the web application will be well-commented, particularly for complex logic involving financial calculations or state changes.
* **MAIN-2:** The application will be architected in a modular fashion to allow for future upgrades or changes to individual components (e.g., the trust scoring algorithm, the AI model) with minimal impact on the rest of the system.

### 2.4 External Interface Requirements

#### 2.4.1 User Interfaces Requirements
* **UI-1: GUI Standards and Style Guide:** The application will adhere to a consistent and modern design system to ensure a professional and intuitive user experience. This includes standardized fonts (e.g., Inter), icons, button styles, color schemes, and component layouts.
* **UI-2: Responsive Design:** The web application must be fully responsive, providing an optimal and seamless user experience on all major devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
* **UI-3: Navigational Consistency:** The system will feature a persistent and clear navigation structure for logged-in users, allowing easy access to the Dashboard, Job Board, Active Projects, and Profile settings.
* **UI-4: Message Display Conventions:** The system will use non-intrusive "toast" notifications to provide feedback to the user for actions like successful submissions, pending transactions, or errors. Critical alerts may use modals to ensure they are acknowledged.

#### 2.4.2 Software Interfaces
* **SI-1: Blockchain Network Interface**
    * **SI-1.1:** The system shall interface with a public JSON-RPC endpoint of an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network (e.g., Polygon) to read data from smart contracts and to broadcast signed transactions for execution.
* **SI-2: User Wallet Interface**
    * **SI-2.1:** The system shall integrate with browser-based Ethereum wallet extensions via the window.ethereum provider API (for wallets like MetaMask) and WalletConnect for connections to mobile and other desktop wallets. This interface is used exclusively for authentication and prompting the user to sign transactions.
* **SI-3: Decentralized Storage Interface**
    * **SI-3.1:** The system shall use a client-side library or a gateway API to interact with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for uploading and retrieving large files, such as portfolio items and dispute evidence.

#### 2.4.3 Hardware Interfaces
As DeTrust is a web-based decentralized application, it does not directly interface with any specialized hardware components. All interactions are handled through the user's standard computer or mobile device.

#### 2.4.4 Communications Interfaces
* **CI-1: Blockchain Node Communication**
    * **CI-1.1:** The client-side application will communicate with a blockchain node provider (e.g., Infura, Alchemy) over a secure WebSocket (WSS) or HTTPS connection to receive real-time event updates from the smart contracts and to query the state of the blockchain.
* **CI-2: Off-Chain Notifications**
    * **CI-2.1:** The system may use a lightweight backend service to manage off-chain notifications. This service will use WebSockets to push real-time alerts to the user's browser (e.g., "You have received a new proposal").
    * **CI-2.2:** For critical asynchronous events (e.g., dispute resolution outcomes, password resets for email accounts), the system shall send notifications to the user's registered email address via an external email service.
